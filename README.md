## Here are four examples showing different usages of xstate.

Each one was built upon the previous one, hence it's recommended to start with `crud-v1-services` and move forward from there. All examples also available on codesandbox, feel free to play, fork and report any issues you found here.

## Core features of each example

### `crud-v1-services`

- A typical CRUD app showing how to `model` application states with `statechart` and implement the basic functionalities in `xstate`, pay attention to how `invoked` Services are used to serve different API calls.

- There are four kind of services in `xstate`, which are `Promise, Callback, Observable and Machine`, for this example we are focused on `Callback` because it's the most commonly used services in a real world application.

- Read about different kind of [Services here](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/communication.html#invoking-services)

### `crud-v2-optimistic-update`

- `v2` is built upon `v1`, but with more delicate handling of `optimistic update` processing and used different child state to model the app, observe how `parallel` states were used to handle different steps of each operation also pay attention to both `happy` and `sorrow` paths.

### `crud-v3-promises`

- `v3` is a slightly differnt version based on `v2` using a different `invoked` Service called `Promise`, pay attention to `services.js` and see how `loadItems` and `deleteItem` worked.

- Key different between `Callback` and `Promise` service is you get to dispatch events back to the parent just once with `Promise`, whereas in `Callback` you could use `cb` and `onReceive` functions to dispatch events multiple times, both has it's own place in an application, hence this example.

### `crud-v4-actors`

- `v4` is based on David's [TodoMVC](https://codesandbox.io/s/xstate-todomvc-33wr94qv1) example but with a couple of improvements.

- This is by far the most complex example, it showcased how to use the latest `Actor` model for communication between child components and their parent.

- Pay attention to how `TodosMachine` spawned child `TodoMachine`s and pass it's ref to each child component as a local single truth that handles the component state., more details in the folder's `Readme.md`

- See detailed docs on [actor here](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/actors.html), this is something you don't want to miss ðŸ˜Ž

- In short, `Service` and `Actor` are basically the same thing but used differently, rule of thumb:

	- Statically invoke services (you have to write all services in machine statemenet in advance)
	- Dynamically spawn actors (you can spawn new actors from any events whenever needed)

## Notes

- Generic naming convention for `states` and `events` are:

	- `camelCaseForState`

	- `UPPER.CASE.FOR.EVENT`

		- By using dot for event it is possible in the future to implement wildcase event matching, for example `UPPER.*` to match all events starting with `UPPER`

- Basic guiding rule for all these example are hoping to make `ui` a `dumb layer`
	- meaning ui only does two things
		- draw the user interface
		- accept user inputs (keyboard/mouse events)
	- then delegate those events to `xstate` to handle, where all business logics are encapsulated

- PRs welcomed and feel free to open issues for any bugs or question you might have.

## Todo

- Rewrite tests

- Enable `whyDidYouRender` to see if there's any unnecesary re-renders
